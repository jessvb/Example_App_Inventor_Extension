# MIT App Inventor Extension Source Code
This repo contains the source code for an example App Inventor Extension that enables App Inventor to connect with Amazon Alexa skills. 

## Generating a .aix File for MIT App Inventor
To generate a .aix file to import into App Inventor, place the .java source code in `appinventor-sources\appinventor\components\src\com\google\appinventor\components\runtime` within the [MIT App Inventor Sources](https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources), cd into `appinventor-sources\appinventor`, and run `ant extensions`. This generates the .aix file in `appinventor-sources\appinventor\components\build\extensions`.
Once the .aix file has been generated, upload it to [MIT App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/), and use the extension block to create cool apps!
